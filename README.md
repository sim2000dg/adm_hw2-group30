# Repository for 2nd homework of ADM/Data Science @Sapienza

The main file, _Homework2_30thGroup.ipynb_, is the notebook containing the research questions (+ the bonus questions) and the solutions
to the algorithm questions. The notebook has an index with links to every and each section of the text, in order to navigate it better. 
The HTML version of the notebook was also added for ease of consultation.

There is also another important file, _CommandLine.sh_, which holds the solution to the Command Line Question, with comments/explanations inside the file itself. 

The other files are just the single exercises/questions before being polished and merged in the final Jupyter notebook file. They are useful in order to track commits and contributions
from each of the members of the group.
